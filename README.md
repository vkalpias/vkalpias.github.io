Firefox 3D audio bug - OSX
==========================

Run this example in Firefox:

http://vkalpias.github.io/index.html

Normally you would hear a footstep sound playing, however the sound is not heard in Firefox. It does work on Chrome.

Additionally, in OSX, the entire audio for the whole operating system stops working while Firefox is trying to play the sound. When the sound finishes audio returns to normal.

Reproduced in Firefox versions:
* 32.0.3 (OSX 10.9.4 and Windows 8.1)
