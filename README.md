Firefox 3D audio bug - OSX
==========================

* Start playing a sound in your computer - for example start a YouTube video.
* While the sound is playing open up Firefox and run this example: http://vkalpias.github.io/index.html. You will not hear any sounds playing in the entire OS until the audio clip in Firefox is finished.

This does NOT happen when running the example in Chrome.

Reproduced in Firefox versions:
* 32.0.3
* 32.0.1

OSX versions:
* 10.9.4
